# AR-Thermals

- The application uses Unity and C# to map real-time thermal data to objects in Augmented Reality (AR) on the Hololens 2.
- The system uses the Robotic Operating System (ROS) master on Raspberry Pi 4 to implement data transmission capabilities between the Adafruit thermal camera and Hololens 2 and displays a live heat map in the field of view.
- We correlate image targets to real world objects with Vuforia and use virtual elements to make them trackable for spatial awareness.
- Enhanced object-specific informational feedback is provided with gaze and hand interaction modalities.
